The [Quark theme](https://getgrav.org/downloads/themes) has the ability to allow pages to override some of the default options by letting the user set `body_classes` for any page.  The theme will merge the combination of the defaults with any `body_classes` set. This allows you to easily add hero classes to give your blog post some **bling**.
